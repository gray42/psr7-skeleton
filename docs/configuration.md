# Configuration

### Environment configuration

All the app environments variables are stored in the `env.php` file.

The command `php bin/cli.php install` will copy `env.example.php` to `env.php` which should have 
your own variables and never shared or committed into git.

Just rename the file `env.example.php` to `env.php`.
