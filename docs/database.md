## Database

### Database configuration

* You may configure the database settings per server environment.
* The global default settings are stored in `config/defaults.php` > `$settings['db']` 

### Query Builder

This application comes with [cakephp/database](https://github.com/cakephp/database) as SQL query builder.

The database query builder provides a convenient, fluent interface to creating and running database queries. It can be used to perform most database operations in your application, and works great with MySQL and MariaDB.

For more details how to build queries read the **[documentation](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/orm/query-builder.html)**.

### Migrations

This skeleton project provides console access for **[Phinx](https://phinx.org/)** to 
create database migrations. 

**Some basics:**

`Migrations` are for moving from schema to schema (and back, if possible).
`Seeding` is the initial data setup. If you aren't at an initial (seed) state, you need a migration to change data.
`Fixtures` are data for testing purposes.

#### Generating a migration from a diff automatically

```bash
$ ant generate-migration
```

#### Creating a blank database migration

```bash
$ ant create-migration
```

For more details how to create and manage migrations read the 
[Phinx](http://docs.phinx.org/en/latest/) documentation.

### Update schema

Updating the database schema with this shorthand command:

```bash
$ ant migrate-database
```

If `ant` is not installed on the target server, the following command can be used:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phinx migrate -c config/phinx.php
```

### Data Seeding

To populate the database with data for testing and experimenting with the code run:

```bash
$ ant seed-database
```

If `ant` is not installed, you can run this command:

```bash
$ vendor/bin/phinx seed:run -c config/phinx.php
```

You may add more seeds under the directory: `resources\seeds\DataSeed`.

### Resetting the database

The command `refresh-database` will rollback all migrations, 
migrate the database and seed the data. 

**Attention: All data will be lost from the database.**

```
$ ant refresh-database
```
